# tsa-project-2019

This was a game that I made for TSA (tech student association I think) in like 10th grade maybe. It's really bad. I made it in 3 days. I had help from Jake Valentine (@JakeLikesPie on GitHub). He mainly did the sprites and graphics, I wrote most of the absolute spaghetti in this repo.

The category that we were competing for was game design i think. And the first question I got asked when presenting was "What game engine did you use?"

That is still one of the funniest moments I can remember. In my head I just realized that we did not have a chance. I coded this thing in vanilla JavaScript

Yeah, anyway we took 5th and qualified to move on to states or whatever. I didn't go. This thing sucked. The judge couldn't even beat the first level which was hilarious. it's really easy.
